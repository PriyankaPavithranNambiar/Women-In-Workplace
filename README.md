Women have been challenged by inequality in the workforce over the years. Until modern times, legal and cultural practices, combined with the inertia of longstanding religious and educational conventions, restricted women’s entry and participation in the workforce.

The gender pay gap is the gap between what men and women are paid. Most commonly, it refers to the median annual pay of all women who work full time and year-round, compared to the pay of a similar cohort of men. It is important for us to identify which employment sectors and occupations have significant gender pay gap. It is also important for us to identify if there has been any improvement in bridging the gap with respect to time.

We performed exploratory data analysis on the historical data about women’s earnings and employment status with the help of summaries and graphs to discover patterns and to spot anomalies.

There is historical data about women’s earnings and employment status, as well as detailed information about specific occupation and earnings from 2013-2016 from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau about women in the workforce.
