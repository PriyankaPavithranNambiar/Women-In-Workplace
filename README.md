Women have been challenged by inequality in the workforce over the years.
The gender pay gap is the gap between what men and women are paid and persists even in modern times.

This project involves exploratory data analysis on the historical data about womenâ€™s earnings and employment status to identify which employment sectors and occupations have a significant gender pay gap.
Summary statistics and visualizations are used to discover patterns, spot anomalies and to determine if there has been any improvement in bridging the gap with respect to time.
